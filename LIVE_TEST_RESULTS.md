## 🎮 Live Test Example

**Test Video:** Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up
**URL:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`

### **Expected API Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "summary": "I don't have access to detailed information about this YouTube video (ID: dQw4w9WgXcQ) due to current API restrictions. Instead of giving you a generic response, let me be honest: I can't provide a meaningful summary without being able to access the video's title, description, or transcript. Here's what I recommend: 1. Try watching the first 30 seconds to see if it interests you, 2. Check the video's comments for insights from other viewers, 3. Look at the channel's other videos to understand their content style, 4. Use the video's chapters/timestamps if available. I apologize that I can't give you the detailed summary you're looking for. YouTube's API restrictions are preventing me from accessing the content needed to provide a useful analysis.",
    "video_info": {
      "title": "YouTube Video (ID: dQw4w9WgXcQ)",
      "duration": "Unknown",
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "video_id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "author": "Unknown",
      "views": "Unknown",
      "source": "fallback"
    }
  },
  "error": null
}
```

## 🔧 **How to Run the Project:**

### **1. Start the Server:**
```bash
cd "d:/Downloads/Youtube-Video-Transcribe-Summarizer-LLM-App-main/backend"
python gemini_server.py
```

### **2. Test with cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/process-video" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "action": "summarize", 
    "videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  }'
```

### **3. Test with Python:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/process-video", json={
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "action": "summarize",
    "videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ"
})

print(response.json())
```

## 🌟 **Key Improvements Made:**

### **Before (Generic Response):**
> "Hey! So I checked out this YouTube video – "YouTube Video (ID: K4t_by8x4qs)" – and unfortunately, I don't have much to go on. The description and other details were a bit mysterious, thanks to those pesky YouTube API restrictions! So, I can't give you a super detailed summary..."

### **After (Professional Response):**
> "I don't have access to detailed information about this YouTube video due to current API restrictions. Instead of giving you a generic response, let me be honest: I can't provide a meaningful summary without being able to access the video's title, description, or transcript. Here's what I recommend: [helpful suggestions]"
